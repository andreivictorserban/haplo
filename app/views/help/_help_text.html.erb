<h1>Glossary</h1>
<p><strong>Attribute</strong>: used to describe specific elements of a type of object ie a document would have the following attributes: author, title, subject, date.</p>
<p><strong>Browsing</strong>: as an alternative to searching by entering search terms into a search box, you can browse information by scanning a list of contents. Different browsing lists can be created for different organisations.</p>
<p><strong>Controlled field</strong>: an indexing field which can only be completed using entries in a controlled list, as opposed to a field in which you can enter any text.</p>
<p><strong>Embedded search</strong>: a permanently and continuously running search created in a webpage.</p>
<p><strong>Field</strong>: part of an object which includes an attribute, qualifier and value.</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchical subject index</strong>: an index of subject terms arranged hierarchically, thereby showing which are narrower or broader terms of other terms.</p>
<p><strong>HTML</strong>: Hyper-text markup language, used to create webpages.</p>
<p><strong>Latest updates</strong>: a function to gather recent items of interest to the user viewable either on a user&#8217;s latest updates webpage or as an email bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation</strong>: links on the left of each webpage enabling users to move between webpages.</p>
<p><strong>Object</strong>: an entry in the system which records a description of an entity and sometimes the entity itself as an attached file, or text. Also referred to as an <em>item</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Pop-up</strong>: a new window automatically opening in a web browser, you will need pop-ups enabled to use some of the features in PRODUCT_NAME, instructions for enabling pop-ups are different for each web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifier</strong>: a term added to an attribute to clarify a particular instance of that attribute ie sub-title is a qualifier for title.</p>
<p><strong>Relevancy</strong>: search results are listed by relevancy when those items at the top of the list are considered more relevant to the search terms entered.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>: the results of a search are the items displayed which match the search terms entered.</p>
<p><strong>Search illustrator</strong>: a feature in PRODUCT_NAME which displays an illustration of how your search terms will be connected together.</p>
<p><strong>Search operators</strong>: words added to a search by the user to specify how their search terms should be connected. The commonly used search operators are: AND, OR, NOT.</p>
<p><strong>Subject</strong>: the subject of an item is a description of the subject covered by the item. Subject description terms are normally chosen from a pre-compiled controlled list.</p>
<p><strong>Tagging</strong>: assigning description terms to an object from a pre-compiled list to improve search results and enable the object to be found when browsing all objects tagged with a certain term.</p>
<p><strong>Taxonomy</strong>: a subject list systematically arranged to show the relationship between terms, including their hiearchical relationship. A taxonomy would be used in a controlled field to control the terms used to describe objects.</p>
<p><strong>Tray</strong>: a holding place within PRODUCT_NAME into which you can add items which you use later.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: used to distinguish different kinds of object ie a document, book or person are all types of object.</p>

<h1>Search</h1>
<h2>Quick search</h2>
<p>Enter your search terms into the quick search box and hit the return key or click on SEARCH.</p>
<p>For even quicker searching, use the <%= @browser_accesskey %> + F keyboard shortcut to select the quick search box.</p>
<h2>Search operators</h2>
<p>Use</p>
<p>AND + <br>
OR | <br>
NOT !</p>
<p>to connect your search terms:</p>
<p>AND is used to narrow your search, for example <em>garden AND shed</em> retrieves all items containing both <em>garden</em> and <em>shed</em>. Using AND will give less results as you are being more specific about the terms that must appear in your search results. AND is added automatically between search results so there is normally no need to add it yourself. The shortcut for AND is +</p>
<p>OR is used to broaden your search, for example <em>garden OR shed</em> retrieves all items containing <em>garden</em> and all items containing <em>shed</em>, but both terms will not necessarily appear in all the items retrieved. You are being less specific about the terms that must appear in your search results, therefore you will retrieve more results. The shortcut for OR is |</p>
<p>NOT is used to remove results from your search which mention the term you don&#8217;t wish to retrieve. For example, <em>garden NOT shed</em> retrieves all items containing <em>garden</em> but will not display any items that contain <em>shed</em>, even those that also mention garden. NOT should be used sparingly and with caution, as you may unintentionally cut out potentially relevant results. The shortcut for NOT is !</p>
<p>You can combine AND, OR and NOT operators to form more complex queries. The search illustrator, which appears underneath the search box, will explain the search as you type it.</p>
<h2>Stemming, truncation and plurals</h2>
<p>PRODUCT_NAME uses automatic stemming so you don&#8217;t have to worry about the different endings of words in your queries. For example <em>stopping</em> will be treated the same as <em>stop</em>, so a search for <em>stop</em> will find <em>stopping</em> and you can use either in your query.</p>
<p>Stemming also handles singular and plural forms of common words. For instance <em>meetings</em> retrieves <em>meeting</em> and vice versa; and <em>lady</em> retrieves <em>ladies</em>.</p>
<p>However, the singular and plural version of words with irregular plurals are <strong>not</strong> stemmed as equivalents. For instance <em>women</em> does not retrieve <em>woman</em>.</p>
<p>You can use * to search for truncated words ie <em>survi*</em> will find <em>survivor, survival, survive</em>.</p>
<h2>Phrase searching</h2>
<p>To search for a phrase (multiple words next to each other in the same order) enter the phrase within double speech marks ie <em>&#8220;your phrase&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This retrieves items where the words appear next to each other in the same order you specified.</p>
<p>The usual stemming treatment will apply to phrases in double speech marks. For example, a search for <em>&#8220;invoicing template&#8221;</em> will find items which contain the phrase <em>invoice template</em>.</p>
<p>To search for an exact phrase, where stemming does not apply, use single speech marks &#8216;&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<h2>Proximity searching</h2>
<p>To search for a term within a number of words of another term use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>term _10 other</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>the search string above will retrieve all items where the word <em>term</em> is found within ten words of the word <em>other</em>. You can specify any number.</p>
<h2>Search subsets</h2>
<p>You can restrict your search using search subsets via the SEARCH page. Underneath the search box choose your search subset from the drop down menu, <em>Search in</em>. Choosing from this drop down menu will narrow your search to just searching the sections included in the chosen search subset. Your Administrator can edit and add search subsets.</p>
<h2>Field search</h2>
<p>For accurate lookup, click <em>Fields &amp; options</em>, and enter your query in the fields. An item will match the query if it has all the fields you enter.</p>
<p>Your administrator can change the fields to match your requirements.</p>
<p>You can also search for terms in specific fields using the main search box. Enter the field name followed by a : then your search terms, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>author:Austen</em><br>
<em>title:Hamlet</em><br>
<em>subject:coffee</em><br>
<em>type:document</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can search for fields with qualifiers using field/qualifier:</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>title/alternative:by means of natural selection</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can&#8217;t currently search by submitter, submitted date (unless it was entered into the date field) or format of uploaded files (ie excel, word.)</p>
<h2>Date and time search</h2>
<p>You can search the date and time fields as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>date: 2008-01-30</em><br>
for items with this specific date in the date field</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>date: 2008-01-01 .. 2008-12-31</em><br>
for items with dates between this range in the date field</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>date: .. 2008-03-31</em><br>
for items with dates before 31 March 2008 in the date field</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>date: 2008-04-01 ..</em><br>
for items with dates after 1 April 2008 in the date field</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want include the time in the query, use syntax like</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>2008-04-01T12.30</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This must include the <em>T</em> and the <em>.</em> to be unambiguously recognised as a date and time.</p>
<h2>Complex search strings</h2>
<p>Use parenthesis to group concepts within complex search strings, to ensure they are treated as you expect by the search. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>type:presentation and (author:howson or author:johnson)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Search illustrator</h2>
<p>The search illustrator appears when you enter a more complex search. It shows you how the system will search for the terms you&#8217;ve entered.</p>
<p>For instance a search for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>bowl and cat or dog</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>shows the search treated as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>bowl and (cat or dog)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So your search results will contain all items that mention <em>bowl</em> plus either <em>cat</em> or <em>dog</em>.</p>
<h2>Full text document search</h2>
<p>The search includes the full text of all documents uploaded in all major formats (Office, PDF, OpenOffice, iWork &#8217;09, RTF, HTML and plain text.) It does not search the file name of the uploaded file.</p>
<h2>Links to and from a sub-query</h2>
<p>&gt;&gt; finds all items linked to any of the items retrieved by a query. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>John &gt;works-for&gt; type:client</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>finds all the people named John who work for a client (or more precisely, all items which contain the word &#8216;John&#8217; which are linked to client records.)</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; finds all items which are linked from any of the items retrieved by a query. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&lt;author&lt; type:book</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>finds all the people who are linked from books in the author field. These are all the people who have written a book.</p>
<p>Both &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; can be used without a field name to find links in any field.</p>

<h1>Taxonomies</h1>
<p>Taxonomies are used to describe items using hierarchical terms.</p>

<h1>Tray</h1>
<p>The Tray is a holding area for items you&#8217;re going to use later, either in an action elsewhere in PRODUCT_NAME or just to keep a list to refer to later. The tray works a bit like a shopping basket.</p>
